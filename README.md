### what EVEN are those? ###
* Bits of code, not the prettiest, definitely not the finished-est,  most likely started by GPT and edited by me.
* This is my way to access what's on my desktop from anywhere (***ahem*** like that time on the train to Toronto ***ahem***).
* Random ideas I don't have time for, stuff I think will be great when I'm baked... you can have it all.
* This is *maybe* going to be updated; if you do decide to finish something, ***please let me know about it***, as I love to see what mafuckas come up with.
